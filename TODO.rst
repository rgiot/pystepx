 * Finish not finished tutorials
 * refactor code to suppress doublons (create a GPTree class ?)
 * Implement more test case and tutorial in order to explain the use of the library and cover a maximum of code to avoid regression
 * Finish to write the API documentation
 * Finish to write the library documentation
 * Cleanup the tree rules typing (ie, use constants instead of number codes)
 * Implement real ephemeral constants (ie, on object represents the type of the data and its interval, then the value is generated on the fly at the node creation)
 * Create a module for different kind of selection
 * Change the way of parametrize the system
 * Cleanup Cython/Python separation (suppress all the _meta classes and create abstract cython classes)
 * Add the hability to easily add constraints on the gentic operators and tree builder
 * Add a mode with low memory footprint in order to resolve koza problems which swap a lot (on the way)
 * Remove reference to map
